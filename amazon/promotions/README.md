#[Amazon Marketplace Promotions](https://github.com/tdantas/it-interviews/tree/master/basket_checkout)

Amazon is an online marketplace, here is a sample of some of the products available on our site:

    Product code     | Name                     | Price
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    001              | Lavender heart           | £9.25
    002              | Personalised cufflinks   | £45.00
    003              | Kids T-shirt             | £19.95

Our marketing team want to offer promotions as an incentive for our customers to purchase these items.

  If you spend over £60, then you get 10% of your purchase
  If you buy 2 or more lavender hearts then the price drops to £8.50

Our check-out can scan items in any order, and because our promotions will change, it needs to be flexible regarding our promotional rules.

The interface to our checkout looks like this:

```ruby
co = Checkout.new(promotional_rules)
co.scan(item)
co.scan(item)
price = co.total
```

Implement a checkout system that fulfils these requirements.
