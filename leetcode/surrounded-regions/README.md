# [Surrounded Regions](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/description/)

Given a 2D board containing `X` and `O`, capture all regions surrounded by `X`.
A region is captured by flipping all `O`s into `X`s in that surrounded region.

For example,

```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```

After running your function, the board should be:

```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```

## Solution

Avoids recursion.
