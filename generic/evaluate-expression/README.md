# Evaluate an expression

Build a calculator that allows addition and subtraction of positive integers.

Sample input/output:

```
"9+6-12" => 3
"2+1-3+4-7+6-5" => -2
```

For a second part, allow parentheses in our input and evaluate the result.

Sample input:

```
"5+16-((9-6)-(4-2))"
"22+(2-4)"
```
